        # The order in which variables are eliminated in a linear solver
        # can have a significant of impact on the efficiency and accuracy
        # of the method. e.g., when doing sparse Cholesky factorization,
        # there are matrices for which a good ordering will give a
        # Cholesky factor with O(n) storage, where as a bad ordering will
        # result in an completely dense factor.
        #
        # Ceres allows the user to provide varying amounts of hints to
        # the solver about the variable elimination ordering to use. This
        # can range from no hints, where the solver is free to decide the
        # best possible ordering based on the user's choices like the
        # linear solver being used, to an exact order in which the
        # variables should be eliminated, and a variety of possibilities
        # in between.
        #
        # Instances of the ParameterBlockOrdering class are used to
        # communicate this information to Ceres.
        #
        # Formally an ordering is an ordered partitioning of the
        # parameter blocks, i.e, each parameter block belongs to exactly
        # one group, and each group has a unique non-negative integer
        # associated with it, that determines its order in the set of
        # groups.
        #
        # Given such an ordering, Ceres ensures that the parameter blocks in
        # the lowest numbered group are eliminated first, and then the
        # parmeter blocks in the next lowest numbered group and so on. Within
        # each group, Ceres is free to order the parameter blocks as it
        # chooses.
        #
        # If NULL, then all parameter blocks are assumed to be in the
        # same group and the solver is free to decide the best
        # ordering.
        #
        # e.g. Consider the linear system
        #
        #   x + y = 3
        #   2x + 3y = 7
        #
        # There are two ways in which it can be solved. First eliminating x
        # from the two equations, solving for y and then back substituting
        # for x, or first eliminating y, solving for x and back substituting
        # for y. The user can construct three orderings here.
        #
        #   {0: x}, {1: y} - eliminate x first.
        #   {0: y}, {1: x} - eliminate y first.
        #   {0: x, y}      - Solver gets to decide the elimination order.
        #
        # Thus, to have Ceres determine the ordering automatically using
        # heuristics, put all the variables in group 0 and to control the
        # ordering for every variable, create groups 0..N-1, one per
        # variable, in the desired order.
        #
        # Bundle Adjustment
        # -----------------
        #
        # A particular case of interest is bundle adjustment, where the user
        # has two options. The default is to not specify an ordering at all,
        # the solver will see that the user wants to use a Schur type solver
        # and figure out the right elimination ordering.
        #
        # But if the user already knows what parameter blocks are points and
        # what are cameras, they can save preprocessing time by partitioning
        # the parameter blocks into two groups, one for the points and one
        # for the cameras, where the group containing the points has an id
        # smaller than the group containing cameras.
        #
        # Once assigned, Solver::Options owns this pointer and will
        # deallocate the memory when destroyed.
        ParameterBlockOrdering* linear_solver_ordering

        # Sparse Cholesky factorization algorithms use a fill-reducing
        # ordering to permute the columns of the Jacobian matrix. There
        # are two ways of doing this.

        # 1. Compute the Jacobian matrix in some order and then have the
        #    factorization algorithm permute the columns of the Jacobian.

        # 2. Compute the Jacobian with its columns already permuted.

        # The first option incurs a significant memory penalty. The
        # factorization algorithm has to make a copy of the permuted
        # Jacobian matrix, thus Ceres pre-permutes the columns of the
        # Jacobian matrix and generally speaking, there is no performance
        # penalty for doing so.

        # In some rare cases, it is worth using a more complicated
        # reordering algorithm which has slightly better runtime
        # performance at the expense of an extra copy of the Jacobian
        # matrix. Setting use_postordering to true enables this tradeoff.
        bool use_postordering

        # Some non-linear least squares problems have additional
        # structure in the way the parameter blocks interact that it is
        # beneficial to modify the way the trust region step is computed.
        #
        # e.g., consider the following regression problem
        #
        #   y = a_1 exp(b_1 x) + a_2 exp(b_3 x^2 + c_1)
        #
        # Given a set of pairs{(x_i, y_i)}, the user wishes to estimate
        # a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2, and c_1.
        #
        # Notice here that the expression on the left is linear in a_1
        # and a_2, and given any value for b_1, b_2 and c_1, it is
        # possible to use linear regression to estimate the optimal
        # values of a_1 and a_2. Indeed, its possible to analytically
        # eliminate the variables a_1 and a_2 from the problem all
        # together. Problems like these are known as separable least
        # squares problem and the most famous algorithm for solving them
        # is the Variable Projection algorithm invented by Golub &
        # Pereyra.
        #
        # Similar structure can be found in the matrix factorization with
        # missing data problem. There the corresponding algorithm is
        # known as Wiberg's algorithm.
        #
        # Ruhe & Wedin (Algorithms for Separable Nonlinear Least Squares
        # Problems, SIAM Reviews, 22(3), 1980) present an analyis of
        # various algorithms for solving separable non-linear least
        # squares problems and refer to "Variable Projection" as
        # Algorithm I in their paper.
        #
        # Implementing Variable Projection is tedious and expensive, and
        # they present a simpler algorithm, which they refer to as
        # Algorithm II, where once the Newton/Trust Region step has been
        # computed for the whole problem (a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2, c_1) and
        # additional optimization step is performed to estimate a_1 and
        # a_2 exactly.
        #
        # This idea can be generalized to cases where the residual is not
        # linear in a_1 and a_2, i.e., Solve for the trust region step
        # for the full problem, and then use it as the starting point to
        # further optimize just a_1 and a_2. For the linear case, this
        # amounts to doing a single linear least squares solve. For
        # non-linear problems, any method for solving the a_1 and a_2
        # optimization problems will do. The only constraint on a_1 and
        # a_2 is that they do not co-occur in any residual block.
        #
        # This idea can be further generalized, by not just optimizing
        # (a_1, a_2), but decomposing the graph corresponding to the
        # Hessian matrix's sparsity structure in a collection of
        # non-overlapping independent sets and optimizing each of them.
        #
        # Setting "use_inner_iterations" to true enables the use of this
        # non-linear generalization of Ruhe & Wedin's Algorithm II.  This
        # version of Ceres has a higher iteration complexity, but also
        # displays better convergence behaviour per iteration. Setting

        #
